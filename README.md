# Traffic Sign Classification

This project focuses on classifying traffic signs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It utilizes the GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) dataset, which consists of thousands of images representing various traffic signs.

## Dataset

The GTSRB dataset is used for training and evaluation in this project. It contains images of different traffic signs, along with their corresponding labels. The dataset is preprocessed and divided into training and testing sets.
